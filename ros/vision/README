This folder contains three stacks corresponding to the mains steps of objects perception.
Each stack contains various ways to do their respective jobs.

- Segmentation :
Make the difference between objects and the rest of the world in an image
or pointcloud. For now, there is only one method which segment plans in a pointcloud and
then regroup points in clusters (these are our objects). It reproject these clusters
on an rgb image to obtain a rgb segmentation.
- Recognition :
The cluster previously segmented is compared, thanks to some descriptors,
to a database of objects. If possible, the cluster is identified as corresponding to
some object which model is known.
- Localisation :
Thanks to the model of the object, a position of the object is computed
in the localisation step.
