The NUS hand posture dataset-II: 
This is a 10 class  hand posture dataset. The postures are shot in and around National University of Singapore (NUS), against complex natural backgrounds, with various hand shapes
and sizes.  The postures are performed by 40 subjects, with different ethnicities, against different complex backgrounds. The subjects include both males and females in the age 
range of 22 to 56 years. The subjects are asked to show the 10 hand postures, 5 times each. They are asked to loosen the hand muscle after each shot, in order to incorporate the natural
variations in the postures. 

The dataset also consists a set of  background images which does not contain any of the hand postures.

Notes:
1. The folder 'Hand Postures' contains the 10 class hand posture images (160x120 size). Classes 1 to 10 are named with starting letters 'a' to 'j' respectively.  A total of 2000 hand posture images are present in this folder.

2. The folder 'Hand Postures with human noise' contains the 10 class hand posture images (320x240 size) with human noises (face of the posturer, human in the background etc). Classes 1 to 10 are named with starting letters 'a_HN' to 'j_HN' respectively.  A total of 750 hand posture images are present in this folder.

3. The folder 'Backgrounds' contains the background images. A total of 2000 background images are available.

4. All the images are RGB and in .jpeg format.

5. The hand posture detection and recognition results using this dataset is reported in the paper titled "Attention Based Detection and Recognition of Hand Postures Against Complex Backgrounds".
