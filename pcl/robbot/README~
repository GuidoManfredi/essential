ROBBOT : Recognition with Oriented Bounding Boxes for ObjecTs
(obb = oriented bounding box)
This package is divided in three parts


//
// Part I : Training from database
//
OBBComputer class : browse a directory containing .pcd files and compute bounding
boxes for each pcd. Save the results in a file in the directories.

Trainer class : Go get the results from OBBComputer and compute the mean and
covariance of bounding boxes for each class and instance.

Clean class : Erase files left by previous training processes.

//
// Part II : Recognition from training results and input .pcd
//
Reco class : Load a file containing stats about a training set. For a given
pointcloud, computes the mahalanobis distance to each instance/class. Given a
confidence level, can filter the training set to keep only a subset of candidate
objects.

//
// Part III : Test and results extraction for papers
//
Test class : Use the Reco class on a test set and get the N min and max variance instances for each instance/class.
Compute the N closest candidats for a given pointcloud with XYZ and LAB obbs. And
Compute the true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives.
 Deduce the precision-recall curve.
 
NORMAL USE :
Run ./compute_obbs on the whole dataset (training + test) => results files with obbs dimensions
Run train on the training set => means and covariances
Run TestDistances on the test set => best/wrost mean, covariances, number of candidates, precision-recall curves.
